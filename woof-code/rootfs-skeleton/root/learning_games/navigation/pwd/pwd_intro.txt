Our very first Linux command is going to be 'pwd'. 
This command gives you the absolute path of the directory you are currently in. 
Think about it like the folder you're in on a Windows or MacOS file system. 
Try running the command yourself, and see what folder you're currently sitting in! Simply enter:
    - 'pwd'
