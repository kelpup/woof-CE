Why learn Python? Because it's easy to learn and you can do almost anything with it! 

What can you do with Python?
  - grab any sort of info from the web you want with the Beautiful Soup library functions
  - make a neural network and train it to know cats from dogs with Tensorflow library
  - create a 2D video game with the Arcade library  
  - almost anything, really!
  
  Who uses Python?
  - NASA
  - Spotify
  - Pixar
  - you, maybe!
  
The Zen of Python
  Beautiful is better than ugly.
  Explicit is better than implicit.
  Simple is better than complex.
  Complex is better than complicated.
  Flat is better than nested.
  Sparse is better than dense.
  Readability counts.
  Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.
  Although practicality beats purity.
  Errors should never pass silently.
  Unless explicitly silenced.
  In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
  There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.
  Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.
  Now is better than never.
  Although never is often better than *right* now.
  If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.
  If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.
  Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!
