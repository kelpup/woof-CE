VIM
 - lets you edit text files, included in most UNIX systems
 - why learn? because almost any UNIX machine, new or old will have Vim
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
say you have a script file.sh; you can open it by typing:
    vim file.sh

then you're viewing the file in --NORMAL-- mode
things you type will be commands that appear on the bottom right
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
if you want to edit your file, you enter --INSERT-- mode:
    hit the [i] button
    
your mouse might not work, but use the arrow keys to get around
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
when you're done editing it, you can enter --NORMAL-- mode: 
    hit the [esc] button
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
to save your changes, type in --NORMAL-- mode:
    :wq
    
this stands for write quit; write your changes to the file, quit vim
